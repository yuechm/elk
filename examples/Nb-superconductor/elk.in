! Example of how to determine the electron-phonon coupling parameters and
! superconducting transition temperature T_c.

! Note that these calculations are very time-consuming and require many
! computers sharing a common directory to run efficiently. It is also important
! to make sure the results are converged with respect to the various input
! parameters and err on the side of caution. Electron-phonon coupling is still
! an experimental feature at this stage.

! Follow the steps below for niobium on a 4x4x4 q-point grid. This is a time-
! consuming example, so the main results are included in this directory.

!     Step 1: Compute the dynamical matrices and potential derivatives     !
!--------------------------------------------------------------------------!

! This step should be run on as many computers as possible which share the same
! directory on a networked file system - just keep submitting jobs to the queue
! from the same directory. As usual, each job can be individually parallel
! using OpenMP.

! The code works by determining which DYN_Qqqqq_qqqq_qqqq_Sss_Aaa_Pp.OUT files
! need to be calculated. These files contain a single row of a dynamical matrix.
! If a calculation fails to complete, just delete that particular DYN file and
! re-run the code. All the DYN files must be calculated before proceeding to the
! next step.

!-----------------------------------------------------------------------!

! This should be run on one computer. You can plot the dispersion curves in the
! file PHDISP.OUT along with lines corresponding to high symmetry points stored
! in PHDLINES.OUT. The phonon linewidths along the same directions are in the
! file PHLWIDTH.OUT (PHLWLINES.OUT). The electron-phonon coupling parameter,
! lambda, and the estimated T_c is stored in MCMILLAN.OUT. You can also plot the
! Eliashberg function in ALPHA2F.OUT. Compare with the results of Bauer et al.
! in PRB 57, 11276 (1998).
