! Automatic determination of the c/a ratio of MgB2. This is performed with
! geometric optimisation which involves changing of the lattice vectors whilst
! maintaining the unit cell volume.

! Setting 'latvopt' to 1 performs full unconstrained optimisation of the lattice
! vectors. Setting it to 2 results in an iso-volumetric optimisation. In both
! cases, the atomic positions are also optimised. To constrain the atomic
! positions, set the nuclear mass to be a negative number in the species file.
! In the case of MgB2, the atomic positions remain fixed because of symmetry.

! As the calculation progresses, you can plot the files TOTENERGY_OPT.OUT and
! STRESSMAX.OUT to see the change in the total energy and stress tensor. The
! modulus of the maximum force on the atoms is written to FORCEMAX.OUT.

! The updated unit cell geometry is written to GEOMETRY_OPT.OUT. The last entry
! in this file contains the final lattice parameters and atomic positions.
